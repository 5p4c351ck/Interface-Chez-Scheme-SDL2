# Interface-Chez-Scheme-SDL2
SDL2 bindings for Chez Scheme

This is a Scheme interface that provides Scheme bindings to enable graphics rendering through SDL2 subroutines directly from Scheme. Itâ€™s not an extensive library, but rather a flexible, ad-hoc interface where I add functionality as needed.

**Note**: This project is currently under active development.
